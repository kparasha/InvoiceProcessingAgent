# Invoice Processing Agent System

## Overview
An intelligent invoice processing system that leverages multiple AI agents to automate invoice validation, data extraction, and vendor verification. Built for the Cloudflare AI Agents Hackathon, this system demonstrates the power of multi-agent AI systems in automating complex business processes.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Multi-Agent System
- **Extraction Agent**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to extract structured data from invoices
- **Validation Agent**: Validates invoice data against business rules and historical patterns
- **Scraping Agent**: Verifies vendor information using web scraping
- **Voice Notification Agent**: Provides real-time voice notifications for important events

#### 2. Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, TailwindCSS
- **AI/ML**: 
  - OpenAI GPT-4 for data extraction
  - OpenAI TTS for voice notifications
  - Google Gemini for enhanced validation
- **Data Storage**: Local file system (extensible to cloud storage)
- **Web Scraping**: Apify for vendor verification

### System Flow
1. **Invoice Upload**
   - PDF file upload through web interface
   - Initial validation of file format and size
   - Secure file storage in uploads directory

2. **Data Extraction**
   - PDF text extraction using PyPDF2
   - Structured data extraction using GPT-4
   - Validation of extracted data completeness

3. **Multi-Agent Processing**
   - Extraction Agent: Parses invoice content
   - Validation Agent: Checks business rules
   - Scraping Agent: Verifies vendor information
   - Voice Agent: Provides audio notifications

4. **Results Presentation**
